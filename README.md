# terraform-aws-remote-access

Terraform project to deploy a RDSH solution.

## Testing

Manual testing:

```
# Replace "xxx" with an actual AWS profile, then execute the integration tests.
export AWS_PROFILE=xxx 
make terraform/pytest PYTEST_ARGS="-v --nomock"

```
make mockstack/up
make terraform/pytest PYTEST_ARGS="-v"
make mockstack/clean
```
